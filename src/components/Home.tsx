            <h1>The Best Travel Sites</h1>
            <p>The best travel site should be a valuable tool in creating your ideal trip, whether you’re planning an overseas vacation, a business trip, or a weekend road-trip. These websites work like robotic travel agents. Instead of asking you to go to the dozens of airline websites and hundreds of hotel websites to search for your ideal dates and route, travel sites perform all of these searches with a single click. To find the best, we looked for websites which could search for a variety of bookings, and tracked prices and user experiences focusing on flights, rental cars, and hotels, and bring us back the best services at the best prices.</p>

            <h1>How We Chose the Best Travel Sites</h1>
            <h2>Price</h2>
            <p>Price is the undisputed king in the travel world. So you might be surprised to learn that since more than 95 percent of the online travel marketplace is controlled by just two companies (Expedia and Priceline), many of our travel sites found the exact same flights and cars for the exact same price. Our top picks all consistently found us the best prices for the cheapest flights and rentals – though Booking.com won top crown for finding the cheapest price overall and Priceline's unique tool helped us luck into getting a great deal.</p>

            <h1>Flexible Dates</h1>
            <p>Flexible date tools let you see what happens if you slightly adjust dates for a proposed trip. We love being able to compare prices if we left for vacation a day earlier, or came back a day later. If you're bargain hunting and haven't completely set a schedule, flexible dates are a must-have. Kayak was our favorite here, with flexible date results that ranged from one to three days, or even a whole month so you can see what week is best for your summer vacation.</p>
